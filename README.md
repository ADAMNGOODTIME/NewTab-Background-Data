# NewTab-Background-Data
A JSON file of an array of URLs that can be used as the background image or video of a new tab in a chromium based browser using the HTML New Tab chrome extension.

The HTML New Tab chrome extension allows you to create a custom new tab using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I personally wanted to create a custom new tab that randomly loaded an anime image or short video (looped) as the background of any new tab. In attempting to implement this use, I found that the extension cannot handle more than 21 URLs for images and 28 URLs for videos.

This JSON file is meant to be a publicly stored repository of the long list of URLs for anime images and videos that the HTML New Tab extension can then fetch to select and load as a random image or video.
